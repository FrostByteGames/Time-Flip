DESCRIPTION
Two player coop puzzle game. Only one player can move at any one time - think about netball.
Player one can move but player two cannot. He then presses a button that passes the 'ball' to player two.
Player one is then frozen in place unable to move. He then begins spectating the other player to assist.
Players must work together and communicate either via an external VOIP or messaging program, or using in-game messages.


GAMEPLAY
2D side facing platformer game. Mario-esque physics.
Simple WASD controls with E or Space for activating switches/levers/whatever.
Q or E can swap the ability to move to the other player.


PUZZLES
Switches and levers that can open or close doors to open passages.
Close a door to stop an enemy chasing you (time pressured).
Push a button to spring the other player into the air.


DESIGN
Two inanimate objects (from a forest or something?) are infused with a magical power.
Power only strong enough to keep one animate at any one time.
The power/life force has to swap between the two (potential for pretty particle effects showing this).
Power needs to reach a final destination (perhaps a special place in the forest?)
